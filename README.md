# Python Simple Soap Server


> This project a good example implements python soap server. 

In the world of web services, SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) remains a reliable and robust option for communication between applications. To delve into this technology, a Python project has emerged as an excellent example of a SOAP server that supports both JSON and PostgreSQL database integration. This article explores the features and setup of this project, shedding light on its significance in the realm of web development.



## Project Overview

This Python SOAP server project offers a simplified yet comprehensive implementation of a SOAP server. One of its notable strengths lies in its flexibility regarding data storage. Developers can opt to store data either in JSON files or within a PostgreSQL database, offering versatility to accommodate various project requirements.

### Licensing

The project operates under the MIT license, which not only facilitates its use in commercial and open-source projects but also encourages further development and sharing within the community.

### Setting Up the Project

Before diving into the details, let's go through the steps required to set up the project:

##### Supporting Databases:
 - `json`
 - `postgres`
 - `mysql`
 - `mongodb(in development)`


#### 1. Creating a Virtual Environment:
Isolation is key to maintaining a clean and organized development environment. By creating a virtual environment, you ensure that the project's dependencies don't interfere with your system-wide packages.
 
```sh
$ python -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```
#### 2. Installing Dependencies:
The project's functionality depends on certain libraries and modules. You can conveniently install them using the provided requirements.txt file.

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### 3. Setting Environment Variables:
Some configuration parameters are best kept separate from the codebase. By copying the .env.example file to .env, you can set environment-specific variables that the project relies on.
set database type
```sh
$ cp .env.example .env

```
#### 4. Running the Project: 
With the setup in place, you're ready to launch the SOAP server.

```sh
$ python server.py
```
Upon successful execution, you'll receive a confirmation that the SOAP server is up and running.


## Testing the Project

To ensure the server's functionality, testing is essential. A Postman collection is provided with the project, enabling easy and comprehensive testing of the SOAP server's capabilities. This step is especially crucial when you're integrating existing databases into the project.

## Extensibility and Learning

By exploring this project, developers gain valuable insights into building SOAP servers using Python. The modular structure encourages extensibility and further customization to suit specific needs. Additionally, studying the codebase provides a practical learning opportunity for understanding SOAP protocols, JSON handling, and PostgreSQL interactions.
